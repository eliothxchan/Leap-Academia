            So with the decimal system(that's us) we can write <br />
            55 as 5 * 10 + 5 * 1. Now, what if I told you that<br />
            the 2 number system version of that number is 110111?<br />
            <br />
            Wait. That looks like a decimal number!  But it's not!<br />
            Remember, the computer can only use 1 and 0 for numbers,<br />
            so we've had to get a little bit creative to get our numbers<br />
            into them. <br />
<br />
            So in the two number system, often called <b>binary</b>,<br />
            we can rewrite numbers like we do in decimal, but we use<br />
            2 instead! So let's see... <br />
            Starting from the right. <br />
            The 1 is still just 1,                  = 1 <br />
            The next 1 is 1 * 2                     = 2 <br />
            The next 1 is 1 * 2 * 2                 = 4 <br />
            The next 0 is 0 * 2 * 2 * 2             = 0 <br />
            The next 1 is 1 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2         = 16 <br />
            The next 1 is 1 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2     = 32 <br />
            Which totals to                         = 55 <br />
            How about that? So just by counting circuits that are on
            and off, we can now represents real numbers in the computer!
