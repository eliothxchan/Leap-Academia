            So how do computers know anything? Well first, we have to look<br />
            at what we call circuits. Above me right now, tere are a set of<br />
            bars! Click them and see what happens!<br /><br />
            
            You just activated a circuit! A circuit is a kind of like a road<br />
            in electronics. Through circuits we run elextricity, so that all<br />
            our gadgets and what not can turn on. Circuits can only be on or<br />
            off, there's no inbetween. Computers have thousands of circuits<br />
            in them, and they count by turning these on and off. <br /><br />

            When a circuit is turned on, the computer thinks of it as a 1,<br />
            when it is off the compuer thinks of it as a 0. Now, you're<br />
            probably used to counting with 10 numbers! Those 10 numbers<br />
            are the foundation of all of human math, so turns out you can't<br />
            get computers to really understand even basic math without<br />
            a lot of help. Told you, they're dumb!<br /><br />

            When you feel like you've understood what a circuit is, just click<br />
            on to proceed!<br /><br />

            (Oh, and if you feel really adventurous, make sure you go through<br />
            our course on making circuits! It's super fun!)<br /><br />
