            So with the decimal system(that's us) we can write
            55 as 5 * 10 + 5 * 1. Now, what if I told you that
            the 2 number system version of that number is 110111?
            
            Wait. That looks like a decimal number!  But it's not!
            Remember, the computer can only use 1 and 0 for numbers,
            so we've had to get a little bit creative to get our numbers
            into them. 

            So in the two number system, often called <b>binary</b>,
            we can rewrite numbers like we do in decimal, but we use
            2 instead! So let's see...
            Starting from the right. 
            The 1 is still just 1,                  = 1
            The next 1 is 1 * 2                     = 2
            The next 1 is 1 * 2 * 2                 = 4
            The next 0 is 0 * 2 * 2 * 2             = 0
            The next 1 is 1 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2         = 16
            The next 1 is 1 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2     = 32
            Which totals to                         = 55
            
            How about that? So just by counting circuits that are on
            and off, we can now represents real numbers in the computer!
