        <p id = "binary">
            So you have learned about circuits! Now, I told you <br />
            that when a circuit is on, the computer sees that the<br />
            number 1, and a 0 when it is off. Now I want you to <br />
            think a little about human numbers, also know as the<br />
            <b>decimal system</b>.<br />
<br />
            I know, I know. That name sounds a little fancy, but all<br />
            it really means is that all our numbers are made by combining<br />
            the same 10 numbers in different ways. Think how 2, 6 and 3 go<br />
            together to form the number 263! <br />
            Now think about it. In that number, 2 really represents 200, right?<br />
            And 6 representes 60, and 3... Well 3 just represents 3.<br />
            I know, terribly boring ending, but wait! There's more!<br />
            So, 263 can be thought of as, 200 + 60 + 3, which is the same<br />
            as 2 * 100 + 6 * 10 + 3 * 1! Notice something? As we're going<br />
            to the right, the number we're multiplying by gets divided by<br />
            10! It goes 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000 all the way to infinity!<br />
            This is because we are using a 10 number system, so all we have<br />
            to do in a 2 number system is change that number to 2! Let me<br />
            show you what happens!<br />
            <br />
            <br />
            When you feel comfortable with the math in this section,<br />
            go on and I'll show you all about how we get computers<br />
            to understand our numbers!<br />
