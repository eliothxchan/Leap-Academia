            Computers are dumb. I mean really really extremely terribly dumb. 
            You know that one person, who just doesn't get anything? That one
            immensely dumb person we all know? Computers are worse. A lot worse.
            So bad in fact, that to get them to do math, we had to invent a whole 
            new counting system just to get them to understand numbers, or letters
            or anything at all! So how do these dumb things know anything? How
            do they know how to to react to what you do with them?
            This Leap Academia short series will show you how it all happens!
